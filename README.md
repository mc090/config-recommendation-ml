# Effectiveness Analysis of Selected Machine Learning Models in Recommending Configuration Files Based on the Structure of Software Projects

> ðŸš§ Work in Progress

## ðŸ“– About
This project is the practical part of my Master's thesis for the Computer Science program at the University of Silesia in Katowice.

My goal is to explore **machine learning from scratch** by:
- Creating and managing **my own dataset**.
- Training and comparing different ML models.
- Experimenting with preprocessing and evaluation techniques.

Everything runs inside a reproducible **Dev Container** with **Conda** for dependency management.

## Project Structure
```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .devcontainer/      # Devcontainer setup
â”œâ”€â”€ data/               # Custom dataset (or scripts to download/build it)
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for exploration
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                # Application logic
â”œâ”€â”€ environment.yml     # Conda environment definition
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)



### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mc090/config-recommendation-ml.git
cd config-recommendation-ml
```

### Opening in Devcontainer
Open the repo in VS Code.
When prompted, "Reopen in Container".
The devcontainer will automatically install Conda and create the project environment from environment.yml.
