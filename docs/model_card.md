# Model Card

## Intended Use
This model is intended solely for research, focusing on recommending configuration files for programming projects. It supports studies in automated configuration and software analytics.

## Model Architecture
Planned experiments will compare machine learning models from different families, including decision trees, ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks. The goal is to evaluate and contrast the strengths of these approaches for the configuration recommendation task.

## Training Data and Preprocessing
Training data will be sourced from the Public GitHub Repositories Structure Metadata dataset ([Dataset card](./dataset_card.md)). Preprocessing steps will be described as models are developed and evaluated.

## Model Version and Training Dates
- **Version**: Not available yet
- **Training Date**: Not trained yet

## Evaluation Metrics
Each model will be evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Performance Table
A summary table of results for each model and configuration will be added after initial experiments.

## Known Limitations and Biases
Limitations and biases will be documented after model evaluation. This may include dataset representativeness, model generalization, and any observed issues.

## Reproducibility Instructions
Detailed steps for reproducing results will be provided once models are trained and evaluated. All code, data, and environment details will be referenced for each experiment.

## References
Models are based on classic machine learning algorithms. References to relevant literature and resources will be added as experiments progress.

## Deployment Notes
This model is intended for research only and is not planned for deployment. No special requirements for usage at this stage.
